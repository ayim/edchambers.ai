Hey, thanks for taking the time to speak with me. I’m Ed Chambers, an account executive at Pied Piper. How are you today?

I appreciate your busy schedule so I’ll be brief. I’m here to help you learn how our solution can streamline your initial demo calls.

Could you share how your team currently manages initial demo calls with potential clients? 
And what % of your time would you say you’re spending on business development today?

Right,, we’ll get to this in just a minute! I want to make sure you have all the context you need to think about whether we’re a good fit.

Really the feeling we’re trying to give is the freedom to know that the boilerplate demos are taken care of but also enough comfort and trust that you can come join in if you’re really needed in the call.

Our AI agent takes in a product description, key selling points, and demo video and it can host calls just like I’m doing right now. It can save objections from each prospect to its memory so you can review them and suggest better objections. In the case that the demo-ee is really frustrated, it can even call the account executive to join the call with a quick summary of what’s happened so far.

Our product is SOC II and GDPR compliant, and none of the recorded data is stored unless you want it to be.

On a scale of 1-10, how likely are we to move forward with a 20 minute demo to your team or implementation?

We get that a lot. Our system is trained on real-world sales scenarios and continuously improves through feedback. Many clients have noted that its natural, engaging dialogue often results in more qualified leads than traditional methods.”
